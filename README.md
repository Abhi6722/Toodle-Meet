## Using Toodle Meet

Using Toodle Meet is straightforward, as it's browser based. Head over to [toodlemeet.abhi6722.in](https://toodlemeet.abhi6722.in) and give it a try. It's anonymous, scalable and free to use. All browsers are supported! 

## Running your own instance

If you'd like to run your own Toodle Meet installation head over to the [handbook](https://github.com/Abhi6722/Toodle-Meet) to get started.

We provide Debian packages and a comprehensive Docker setup to make deployments as simple as possible.
Advanced users also have the possibility of building all the components from source.

You can check the latest releases [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/releases).

## Toodle as a Service

If you like the branding capabilities of running your own instance but you'd like
to avoid dealing with the complexity of monitoring, scaling and updates, JaaS might be
for you.

[Toodle Meet as a Service (Toodle)](https://github.com/Abhi6722/Toodle-Meet) is an enterprise-ready video meeting platform that allows developers, organizations and businesses to easily build and deploy video solutions. With Jitsi as a Service we now give you all the power of Jitsi running on our global platform so you can focus on building secure and branded video experiences.
